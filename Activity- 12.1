1. Write a program that asks for a users email address. 
2. Pass this email address, as a string, to a function that uses a tuple to split the email address into username, domain, and generic 
top level domain (gTLD - .com, .gov, .edu, .org, .mil, .net). 
3. Make sure your functions tests that they have provided a proper email address format: it must have an @ symbol and a 
. followed by a proper gTLD. For this assignment a proper gTLD is .com, .gov, .edu, .org, .mil, or .net, the actual list 
of proper gTLD's is much longer.
4. Your function should return the username, domain, and gTLD as a tuple.
